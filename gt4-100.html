<p>Gran Turismo 4 is easily one of the greatest racing games of all time, an iconic masterpiece for the PlayStation 2, and probably one of the most time consuming 100% challenges ever. The endurance races alone take multiple days of real world time to complete, so anyone going down this road knows it is going to be a long and grueling journey. However, I am not afraid, and I am going to make it there.</p>
<p>Luckily, I do have a friendly little guide on my side which at least tells me which cars I should be using for the races and roughly what order I should do them in. However, the guide can't help me win the races and complete the game, that's all on me.</p>

</div>
<p>I started the game out by grabbing my B and A licenses, which are needed to get started on the beginner and intermediate level races. Once getting to 25% completion, the game unlocks the endurance races for you, so that was step one.</p>
<p>Winning the first few races, while trying not to spend money on upgrading my cars, wasn't super easy. There were a few tracks that I needed to practice on in order to beat the competition. GT4 gives "A-Spec points" based on how difficult the race should be for you to complete based on your car's power versus the cars you are up against. Some of these early races were netting me near or over 100 A-Spec points a piece, which means I was pretty disadvantaged.</p>
<p>After completing everything in the Beginner Events section, I moved on to the Professional Events section instead. Here the races got a bit more easy to win, mainly because I had enough money now to upgrade my vehicles a little bit before entering the race, giving me an edge on the competition.</p>
<p>Once everything I could do in those sections were complete, I moved on to some of the beginner level Rally events, which are mainly offroad 1v1 races with you just and another car on the track. I actually enjoyed these as a change of pace from just driving on the circuit tracks, and it's fun to drift around the corners. You win an RSC Rally Raid Car from one of the early events, and that thing just blew the other cars out of the water for the rest of the Rally events I could do for now.</p>
<p>After the Rally races, it was time to continue doing more B and A license races in the Japanese, American, and European event sections. These were pretty easy to do, as I had plenty of cash to purchase the cars I needed, and had already won some in other races that came in handy here, like the Cadillac CIEN and Chevy Chevelle in the American races.</p>
<p>My first taste of endurance racing also came here, in the European events. One of the events is called "1000 Miles!" and is a grueling tournament style race, doing many laps across a variety of tracks, I suppose equaling up to 1000 miles if the race name is to be believed. In endurance races, you mainly need to keep an eye on two things, your tire health, and your gas tank. If your tires get too bald, you will start slipping and spinning out on the track, as well as losing acceleration as your tires can't grip as well. If you run out of gas, well, you won't be moving very fast. This is where the pit stop mechanic comes in, useless in normal races, but necessary in endurance races to get you new tires and a full tank of gas.</p>
<p>After these races came some "One Make" races, which are offered at different manufacturers. They are essentially just races where only one vehicle model is allowed in, so everyone is racing in the same car, or at least all from the same manufacturer.</p>
<p>After doing a few of these, I had finally now reached the first major milestone: 25% game completion. This unlocked the Endurance Events section, which are all endurance races, but they get also net you a whole lot of money, over 100k per win, as well as winning you some of the best cars in the game.</p>
<p>This is where I am now, working through the first set of Endurance races that I can do. So far, I used my OPTION Stream Z '04 to win the Laguna Seca 200 miles event, the El Capitan 200 miles event, and the New York 200 miles event. After those, I purchased a Mazda MX-5 Miata 1800 RS (NB, J) '04 and won the Roadster 4 Hour Endurance race which won me a great car: the Mazda RX-7 LM Race Car '01. I used that to win the Tsukuba 9 Hour Endurance race.</p>
<p>As of now, the next race I need to complete is the Motegi 8 Hour Endurance. Once this is done, I can say goodbye to Endurance races for a little while at least, as it will be back to doing One Make races, and then off to get my International B license before going back to more Endurance Events.</p>
<p>I'll be back to chronicle my journey again soon, likely after getting my International B license and seeing what Endurance Events are up for me next.</p>
<p><strong>First Update</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's been a few days, and I am back now to add an update here on May 30th.</p>
<p>I finished the Motegi 8 Hour Endurance race that I was on, and once that was done, it was time to compete in a bunch of One-Make races.</p>
<p>This was a very welcome change of pace, as I got to have some fun driving a variety of vehicles, things like the Mini Cooper, and even an old Citroen from 1954 that could barely reach a top speed of 50mph.</p>
<p>Luckily, most of these races were easy to win, but I did have some difficulty getting used to some of the cars that had very unique handling.</p>
<p>After spending a bunch of money buying these new cars and doing the One-Makes, it was now time for my International B License.</p>
<p>This license test wasn't too tough, or maybe I've just been doing so many laps now that I'm used to a lot of these tracks that the tests were on. Either way, I blasted through and got the weird Nike One car, which I think is a concept car, it looks goofy.</p>
<p>With my new license in hand, there were now many new races available to me, so it was back to the Endurance Events.</p>
<p>First, I hopped in the Minolta Toyota 88C-V Race Car I had won from one of the previous endurance races I believe, and did an extremely fast paced race on the Super Speedway for 150 miles, which was pretty fun albeit a bit boring.</p>
<p>After that, it was time to hop back in my trusty old Mazda RX-7 LM Race Car and complete 4 more endurance races: Grand Valley 300km, Tokyo R246 300km, Nurburgring 4 hour, and the Suzuka 1000km.</p>
<p>This is where I'm at right now, and I am now on one of the most grueling endurance challenges: 24 Hours of Nurburgring. My guide suggests using my newly won Chaparral 2D Race Car, which I believe is faster than my trusty Mazda that I used for the 4 hours on Nurburgring and wasn't too bad. This is probably going to be tougher in a different, and likely much faster, car.</p>
<p>As of now, I'm at 35.3% game completion, and 100% feels so far away still. Luckily, after doing the 24h Nurburgring endurance, I'll be completing a bunch more one-makes, and it looks like we're heading back to the rally and special events. The reason I kind of have to do this 24h one first is because I need the car I win from there to do a bunch of these next races since it's one of the best.</p>
<p>I'll probably hop back in for another update after completing this 24h Nurburgring race, since it's going to be brutal. Until then, back to the race track.</p>
