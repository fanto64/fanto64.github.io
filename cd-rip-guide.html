        <p><p>This guide assumes you've already followed my <a href="https://fanto64.github.io/eac-install-guide.html">EAC Install Guide</a> so if you haven't, go do that first, then come back here.</p>
<h1>CD Rip Guide</h1>
<ol>
<li>Open Exact Audio Copy.</li>
<li>Insert the disc you want to rip into your drive.</li>
<li>A window should popup and begin to search for Metadata. Let it do it's thing, and once it's done, select the correct version of your disc from the list and a cover image, and then hit OK.</li>
<li>Make sure all of the tags are correct and how you want them. If it's a multi-disc album, make sure to set the correct Number of CDs and CD Number.</li>
<li>Now, at the top of the window, head to Action -&gt; Detect Gaps, and allow it to do it's thing detecting the gaps between the tracks.</li>
<li>Now, it's time to prepare for the rip.</li>
<li>Make sure you have an easy to access folder to store your rips, like "C:\Rips".</li>
<li>Now, in EAC, head to Action -&gt; Create CUE Sheet -&gt; Multiple WAV Files With Gaps... (Noncompliant)</li>
<li>Navigate to your C:\Rips folder, and create a new folder with the following naming convention, which you may recognize from my Vinyl Rip Guide:<ul>
<li>Artist - Album (Original Release Year) [FLAC] {Re-release Year - Country of Origin - Record Label - Catalog Number}</li>
<li>So, using Dark Side of the Moon as our example again, it would look like: 
Pink Floyd – Dark Side of the Moon (1973) [FLAC] {Harvest – SMAS-11163}</li>
<li>Or, if it was a remastered version, it might look like this instead:
Pink Floyd – Dark Side of the Moon (1973) [FLAC] {2016 Remastered – US – Pink Floyd Records – PFRLP8}</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enter the newly created folder, and hit Save to save the cuesheet there.</li>
<li>Now, we're ready to rip. Head to Action -&gt; Test &amp; Copy Selected Tracks -&gt; Compressed. It should pop up with a browse window which already has your newly created folder from step 9, so just hit OK.</li>
<li>And now we are ripping! Simply sit back and wait for the process to complete as it rips each track and then compresses it to FLAC.</li>
<li>Once it's done, you can take the CD out of your drive, and if you have more discs to rip, simply repeat the whole process starting from step 2.</li>
</ol></p>
